                <p class="paragraph">Knowing how to write an analysis paragraph makes writing analytical essays easier. An analysis paragraph is a paragraph that responds to analytical issues. A good analysis paragraph should support the claim or thesis statement that is presented at the end of an introductory paragraph of an analysis essay. It does this by providing evidence, which can be a quote, and explaining how the work and literary features enhance the impact or contribute to the success of the work as a whole piece.</p>
